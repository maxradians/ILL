# ILL
This is the source code for my game Ill. Admittedly, it's not very good (and also very unorganized).

For context, this game was originally published to itch.io on Janurary 27th, 2025. It's pretty basic and the most impressive thing about it is that it has random room generation.

NOTE: This repository doesn't include the files for Allegro 5, which is what Ill uses for graphics and inputs. If you wish to make your own project using this code, you will have to download the files for Allegro 5 as well.
